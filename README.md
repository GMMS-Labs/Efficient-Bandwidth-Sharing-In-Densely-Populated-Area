## Problem Statement  
#### Challenges in Densely Populated Areas
- Network congestion leading to reduced Quality of Service (QoS).
- High demand for bandwidth during events or peak hours.
- Uneven distribution of network resources.
- Lack of real-time insights into user movement and bandwidth requirements.

## Proposed Solution
#### Efficient Bandwidth Sharing Framework
- Leverage open network APIs for adaptive resource allocation.
- Prioritize quality and reliability based on demand patterns.
- Real-time analytics for proactive network optimization.
- Dynamic bandwidth sharing tailored to crowd density and movement.
 
## Key Enablers
#### Quality On Demand (QoD):
- Dynamically allocate bandwidth based on real-time user needs.
- Enhance video streaming, gaming, and emergency communications.
Connectivity Insights:
- Monitor network performance metrics in real-time.
- Identify bottlenecks and areas of high demand.
High-Speed Real-Time Crowd Flow Analysis:
- Predict crowd movement using AI-powered analytics.
- Optimize resource deployment for seamless connectivity.

## Implementation Architecture
#### Multi-Layered Bandwidth Sharing Framework
- Data Collection Layer: Real-time data from QoD, Connectivity Insights, and Crowd Flow APIs.
